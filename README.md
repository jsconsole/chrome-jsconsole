### CONTRIBUTING
- ### Setup
    - [Fork **jsconsole.github.io**](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and clone it on your system.
    -  Create a new branch out off `master` for your fix/feature. `git checkout -b new-feature`

- ### Things to remember
    - Do not fix multiple issues in a single commit. Keep them one thing per commit so that they can be picked easily in case only few commits require to be merged.
    - Before submitting a patch, rebase your branch on upstream `master` to make life easier for the merger.
    - **DO NOT** commit automatic build files or folders (`dist/** || node_modules || etc`) in your commits.
